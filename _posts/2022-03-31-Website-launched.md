Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (right click to open in new tab) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Special thanks to Jonathan McGlone for a very handy tutorial! If anyone is interested to use GitHub to build their personal webpage, do check out [this blogpost](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) (right click to open in new tab)
